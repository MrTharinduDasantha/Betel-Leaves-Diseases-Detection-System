            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
              The Betel Leaf Diseases Detection System is a comprehensive
              platform designed to assist farmers and agricultural officers in
              the management of betel leaf cultivation. Users can register as
              either an admin (Agricultural Officer) or a user (Farmer) to
              access various features of the system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our system allows users to identify betel leaf diseases through
              our advanced AI model, providing detailed solutions including
              Disease Identification, Symptoms, Treatment Methods, and
              Preventative Measures. Information about maintaining healthy betel
              cultivation is also available, with administrators having the
              ability to update these solutions as needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond disease identification, our platform offers additional
              features such as a Community Forum where farmers can share
              cultivation challenges and experiences, a Consult Officer section
              for direct communication with agricultural experts, and a
              Cultivation Guide with comprehensive instructions for betel
              farming.

          <!-- Dataset Description -->
          <div class="about-section">
            <h3>Dataset Information</h3>
            <p>
              Our disease detection model is trained on a specialized dataset of
              betel leaf images, categorizing them into four distinct
              conditions: healthy, dried, afflicted by bacterial disease, and
              suffering from fungal brown spot disease. Captured in Camperhat,
              Raipur, Lakshmipur, Bangladesh, this collection demonstrates a
              meticulous approach to data gathering for disease identification.
            </p>
            <p>
              The dataset contains 3589 images organized into Original (1000
              images) and Augmented (2589 images) folders. The Augmented folder
              is further divided into training (2388 images) and testing (201
              images) subsets, designed to support both deep learning and
              machine learning algorithms for precise classification of betel
              leaf health conditions.
